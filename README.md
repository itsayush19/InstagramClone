Used Back4app.com as a backend for app and setting up parse server.
App contains signup and login activity for signing up and logging in the user.
App contains a Social media activity which has three fragment tabs i.e. ProfileTab for updating user's info, UserTab which contains other users list, SharePictureTab for sharing and posting pictures.
in UserTab when a user name is clicked we can see their posts and when long clicked we can see their information.
